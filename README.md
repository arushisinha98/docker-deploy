The goal was to practice how to turn a machine learning model into an API. This knowledge is to be used for stable model deployment to a UI and is most applicable in my National Library Board project, where my team will be working on a recommendation model that outperforms the existing AWS Personalize system. A key component of this project is the ability to ingest test users data, reveal some recommendations, and learn from the user's acceptance or rejections of the given recommendations.
